band_of_the_hour <- "The Frost Band of the Hour, sometimes abbreviated as simply Band of the Hour, is the marching band at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida. The band plays at all home Miami Hurricanes football games and selected away games. It also travels to post-season football bowl games in years that the football team plays at one. The band's name originated during the 1948 Orange Bowl halftime show, when Henry Fillmore announced that the \"Man of The Hour\" march was being played by the \"Band of the Hour\". The band decided to keep the name. The band was founded in 1933 by Walter E. Shaeffer, who had served with the United States Marine Band as a musician and concertmaster. During the 1950s, composer Henry Fillmore became a major patron of the band. He provided funding for the construction of Henry Fillmore Band Hall, the band's home base. Since 1993, the Band of the Hour is supported by the Band of the Hour Association, an alumni group. The association maintains a hall of fame for the band. Alumni also play or march with the band during homecoming football games."
